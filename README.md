This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

##  Features i have implemented in Hr-dashboard Portal is 

1. Display all the employee data in page.tsx file (routes :/)
2. Added a Bookmark,view,and promote option in each employee card 
3. promote will only work on Bookmark page because the hr cannot directly promote the employee first he/she have to saved the employee 
4. On Employe view page hr can see the project status of the employee (using dummy data as mentioned in the assignment ),overview of employee and dummy feedback (these all are can be accessed using tabs as mentioned in the assignment )
5. Also implement user authentication by creating user model and in the lib file there is dummy database which will hold the value of user while register and login 
6. Used a dummy api (which was mentioned in the assigment and handle only 20 employee limit )for all type of information of employee.
7. All the pages are responsive and can be easily viewed in mobile(iphone and android),tablet and laptop
8. Added a analytics page for displaying the overall report of the emplopyee

## Nextjs features Use

1. As all of my files are inside the app folder so for static site generation i have used App router with getstaticparams
2. Created my own custom hook for search and filter the employee details and also reduce the code lines of main page 
3. Used a Context api for bookmarks features to available the bookmarks data globally and without loading it should available 
4. Uses router and link for navigating through different pages 
5. Used a Shadcn component and tailwind css for keeping the code clean ,readable,syncronized and finished the project on time 
6. I have also created my own custom component which is mobile.tsx and usercard.tsx file so that i can customize according to my self because card was everthing in the project so i have used shadcn cards and later i customized according to the need.
7. Use charts for displaying the data in the form of graph in the analytics page 
8. For every type of icons i have used lucide -react so that i dont need to manually download and use the icon 
9. In some files i have used toast for giving the notifications of success only not for failure
